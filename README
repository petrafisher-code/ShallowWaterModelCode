Compilation:
	*you will need to install NETCDF on your system and note the directories where the 
	library and module reside. 
	*in the Makefile change the variables NETCDF_FOR, NETCDF_C and NETCDF_LIB to suit 
	 your system. Sometimes when compiling NETCDF you may have to install both the 
	 fortran and c versions. If you do not need to do this, set NETCDF_FOR and NETCDF_C
	 equal to the same value. 
	*If you install both c and fortran versions, set NETCDF_LIB to -lnetcdff
	*If you only need to install one version, set NETCDF_LIB to lnetcdf
	*Finally, once netcdf is installed and the make file is edited, type "make" to compile
	 the code
        *Note, these variables are commented out in the Makefile. You may set them as environment
         variables in your .bashrc, or .bash_profile and the Makefile will pick them up.
Doxygen pages:
	*self generating documentation (from the source code) can be created by typing
	 "doxygen fortran.dxg" at the command line.
	*you can then view the html pages by opening the file at "doxygen/html/index.html"
Running code:
	*run the code by typing the following:
	* single processor: ./main.exe namelist.in
	* mpi job: mpiexec -n 32 ./main.exe namelist.in
Contributing development:
	* at the moment the code is under private repo with no development branches. Contact 
		the code owner to contribute ideas.
